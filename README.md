It provides:

- a set of CSS variables for colors and font size variants
- an animated background gradient (that can be deactivated)
- media queries to manage generic content at most resolutions
- image or survey name in title
- adaptive base font size
- question shortcut display above question caption
- footer with up to two containers for secondary / optional text/ links

_Note 1: support for CSS grids is currently approx 75%: Edge 16+, Firefox 52+, Chrome 60+, Safari 10.1+ and Opera 48+ only._

_Note 2: for legacy browsers, [this polyfill](https://github.com/FremyCompany/css-grid-polyfill/) can be used._
